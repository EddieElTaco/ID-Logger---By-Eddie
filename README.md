# ID-Logger---By-Eddie
Parses submitted data  and helps export report of scanned IDs

Description:
ID Logger is a lightweight web app designed to quickly scan, track, and export badge/ID card data. It reads your CSV files containing badge rosters and incoming badge info, then lets you scan or type badge UIDs continuously to log attendance or check-ins with instant feedback. It handles duplicates, highlights special flags (like Early Arrival or specific rooms), and exports logs as timestamped Excel files.

Auto-detect file types or manually assign them

Continuous scan mode: scan or type UIDs, get instant info display

Duplicate scan warnings

Visual flags for Early Arrival (EA) and “Inn” rooms

Export scanned logs as XLSX files with custom timestamped filenames

Dark mode toggle for easier use in low-light environments

How to Use:
